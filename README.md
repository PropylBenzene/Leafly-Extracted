# Leafly-Extracted
This is a project to pull data reliably from their API to do at first price comparisson on multiple strains from multiple dispensaries. It will evolve.

Currently, it only pulls from a very close and specific dispensary that is starting to use a standarized naming system. The end result outputted is the name of the has and the pricing.
